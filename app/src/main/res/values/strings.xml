    <string name="app_name">Black hole</string>

    <string name="des">black hole is a place in space where gravity pulls so much that even light can not get out. The gravity is so strong because matter has been squeezed into a tiny space. This can happen when a star is dying. Because no light can get out, people can\'t see black holes. They are invisible. Space telescopes with special tools can help find black holes. The special tools can see how stars that are very close to black holes act differently than other stars.</string>
    <string name="size_explanation_1">Black holes can be big or small. Scientists think the smallest black holes are as small as just one atom. These black holes are very tiny but have the mass of a large mountain. Mass is the amount of matter, or \"stuff,\" in an object. </string>
    <string name="size_explanation_2">Another kind of black hole is called \"stellar.\" Its mass can be up to 20 times more than the mass of the sun. There may be many, many stellar mass black holes in Earth\'s galaxy. Earth\'s galaxy is called the Milky Way. </string>
    <string name="size_explanation_3">The largest black holes are called \"supermassive.\" These black holes have masses that are more than 1 million suns together. Scientists have found proof that every large galaxy contains a supermassive black hole at its center. The supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way galaxy is called Sagittarius A. It has a mass equal to about 4 million suns and would fit inside a very large ball that could hold a few million Earths. </string>
    <string name="bh_form">Scientists think the smallest black holes formed when the universe began. Stellar black holes are made when the center of a very big star falls in upon itself, or collapses. When this happens, it causes a supernova. A supernova is an exploding star that blasts part of the star into space. Scientists think supermassive black holes were made at the same time as the galaxy they are in.(opens in new tab)</string>
    <string name="event_horizon">The Event Horizon Telescope, a planet-scale array of eight ground-based radio telescopes forged through international collaboration, captured this image of the supermassive black hole in the center of the galaxy M87 and its shadow.

    <string name="types_of_bh">There are four types of black holes: stellar, intermediate, supermassive, and miniature. The most commonly known way a black hole forms is by stellar death. As stars reach the ends of their lives, most will inflate, lose mass, and then cool to form white dwarfs. But the largest of these fiery bodies, those at least 10 to 20 times as massive as our own sun, are destined to become either super-dense neutron stars or so-called stellar-mass black holes. In their final stages, enormous stars go out with a bang in massive explosions known as supernovae.</string>
    <string name="types_of_bh_1">Such a burst flings star matter out into space but leaves behind the stellar core. While the star was alive, nuclear fusion created a constant outward push that balanced the inward pull of gravity from the star\'s own mass. In the stellar remnants of a supernova, however, there are no longer forces to oppose that gravity, so the star core begins to collapse in on itself. If its mass collapses into an infinitely small point, a black hole is born. Packing all of that bulk—many times the mass of our own sun—into such a tiny point gives black holes their powerful gravitational pull. Thousands of these stellar-mass black holes may lurk within our own Milky Way galaxy.</string>
    <string name="types_of_bh_2">When a star burns through the last of its fuel, the object may collapse, or fall into itself. For smaller stars (those up to about three times the sun\'s mass), the new core will become a neutron star or a white dwarf. But when a larger star collapses, it continues to compress and creates a stellar black hole. \n\nBlack holes formed by the collapse of individual stars are relatively small but incredibly dense. One of these objects packs more than three times the mass of the sun into the diameter of a city. This leads to a crazy amount of gravitational force pulling on objects around the object. Stellar black holes then consume the dust and gas from their surrounding galaxies, which keeps them growing in size.</string>
    <string name="types_of_bh_3">Small black holes populate the universe, but their cousins, supermassive black holes, dominate. These enormous black holes are millions or even billions of times as massive as the sun but are about the same size in diameter. Such black holes are thought to lie at the center of pretty much every galaxy, including the Milky Way.\n\nScientists aren\'t certain how such large black holes spawn. Once these giants have formed, they gather mass from the dust and gas around them, material that is plentiful in the center of galaxies, allowing them to grow to even more enormous sizes.\n\nSupermassive black holes may be the result of hundreds or thousands of tiny black holes that merge. Large gas clouds could also be responsible, collapsing together and rapidly accreting mass. A third option is the collapse of a stellar cluster, a group of stars all falling together. Fourth, supermassive black holes could arise from large clusters of dark matter. This is a substance that we can observe through its gravitational effect on other objects; however, we don\'t know what dark matter is composed of because it does not emit light and cannot be directly observed.</string>
    <string name="types_of_bh_4">Scientists once thought that black holes came in only small and large sizes, but research has revealed the possibility that midsize, or intermediate, black holes (IMBHs) could exist. Such bodies could form when stars in a cluster collide in a chain reaction. Several of these IMBHs forming in the same region could then eventually fall together in the center of a galaxy and create a supermassive black hole.\n\nIn 2014, astronomers found what appeared to be an intermediate-mass black hole in the arm of a spiral galaxy. And in 2021 astronomers took advantage of an ancient gamma-ray burst to detect one. \"Astronomers have been looking very hard for these medium-sized black holes,\" study co-author Tim Roberts, of the University of Durham in the United Kingdom, said in a statement(opens in new tab). \"There have been hints that they exist, but IMBHs have been acting like a long-lost relative that isn\'t interested in being found.\" \n\nResearch, from 2018, suggested that these IMBHs may exist in the heart of dwarf galaxies (or very small galaxies). Observations of 10 such galaxies (five of which were previously unknown to science before this latest survey) revealed X-ray activity — common in black holes — suggesting the presence of black holes of from 36,000 to 316,000 solar masses. The information came from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, which examines about 1 million galaxies and can detect the kind of light often observed coming from black holes that are picking up nearby debris. </string>
    <string name="types_of_bh_5">In 2015, astronomers using the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) detected gravitational waves from merging stellar black holes.\n\n\"We have further confirmation of the existence of stellar-mass black holes that are larger than 20 solar masses — these are objects we didn\'t know existed before LIGO detected them,\" David Shoemaker, the spokesperson for the LIGO Scientific Collaboration (LSC), said in a statement(opens in new tab). LIGO\'s observations also provide insights into the direction a black hole spins. As two black holes spiral around one another, they can spin in the same direction or the opposite direction.\n\nThere are two theories on how binary black holes form. The first suggests that the two black holes in a binary form at about the same time, from two stars that were born together and died explosively at about the same time. The companion stars would have had the same spin orientation as one another, so the two black holes left behind would as well.\n\nUnder the second model, black holes in a stellar cluster sink to the center of the cluster and pair up. These companions would have random spin orientations compared to one another according to LIGO Scientific Collaboration. LIGO\'s observations of companion black holes with different spin orientations provide stronger evidence for this formation theory.\n\n\"We\'re starting to gather real statistics on binary black hole systems,\" said LIGO scientist Keita Kawabe of Caltech, who is based at the LIGO Hanford Observatory. \"That\'s interesting because some models of black hole binary formation are somewhat favored over the others even now, and in the future, we can further narrow this down.\"</string>
    <string name="layers_1">Black holes have three \"layers\": the outer and inner event horizon, and the singularity. The event horizon of a black hole is the boundary around the mouth of the black hole, past which light cannot escape. Once a particle crosses the event horizon, it cannot leave. Gravity is constant across the event horizon. The inner region of a black hole, where the object\'s mass lies, is known as its singularity, the single point in space-time where the mass of the black hole is concentrated. </string>
    <string name="layers_2">The EHT\'s image of a black hole in M87 (released in 2019) was an extraordinary effort, requiring two years of research even after the images were taken. That\'s because the collaboration of telescopes, which stretches across many observatories worldwide, produces an astounding amount of data that is too large to transfer via the internet. With time, researchers expect to image other black holes and build up a repository of what the objects look like. The next target is likely Sagittarius A*, which is the black hole in the center of our own Milky Way galaxy. Sagittarius A* is intriguing because it is quieter than expected, which may be due to magnetic fields smothering its activity, a 2019 study reported. Another study that year showed that a cool gas halo surrounds Sagittarius A*, which gives unprecedented insight into what the environment around a black hole looks like.</string>

    <string name="fact_1">• If you fell into a black hole, theory has long suggested that gravity would stretch you out like spaghetti, though your death would come before you reached the singularity. But a 2012 study published in the journal Nature(opens in new tab) suggested that quantum effects would cause the event horizon to act much like a wall of fire, which would instantly burn you to death.</string>
    <string name="fact_2">• Black holes don\'t suck. Suction is caused by pulling something into a vacuum, which the massive black hole definitely is not. Instead, objects fall into them just as they fall toward anything that exerts gravity, like the Earth.</string>
    <string name="fact_3">• The first object considered to be a black hole is Cygnus X-1. Cygnus X-1 was the subject of a 1974 friendly wager between Stephen Hawking and fellow physicist Kip Thorne, with Hawking betting that the source was not a black hole. In 1990, Hawking conceded defeat.</string>
    <string name="fact_4">• Miniature black holes may have formed immediately after the Big Bang. Rapidly expanding space may have squeezed some regions into tiny, dense black holes less massive than the sun. </string>
    <string name="fact_5">• If a star passes too close to a black hole, the star can be torn apart(opens in new tab). </string>
    <string name="fact_6">• Astronomers estimate that the Milky Way has anywhere from 10 million to 1 billion stellar black holes, with masses roughly three times that of the sun. </string>
    <string name="fact_7">• Black holes remain terrific fodder for science fiction books and movies. Check out the movie \"Interstellar,\" which relied heavily on Thorne to incorporate science. Thorne\'s work with the movie\'s special effects team led to scientists\' improved understanding of how distant stars might appear when seen near a fast-spinning black hole.</string>
